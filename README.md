<hr/>

Multi OBS Controller plugin for Elgato Stream Deck allows you to remotely control one or multiple OBS Studio instances at the same time in an easy way. You can keep them synchronized or manage them individually, it's all up to you! It's ideal for double OBS setups (one instance for streaming, one instance for recording) that you need to control simultaneously.

Requires OBS Studio v29.0 or later (which supports OBS Websockets v5 protocol).
